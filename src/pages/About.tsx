      re;love is a small, thoughtful space for students to let go of things they no longer need —
      and find something that fits into their lives next. Every item carries a story: the laptop
      that got you through late-night assignments, the lamp that once kept you company, the chair
      that’s seen too many naps between classes. Here, they all get to continue — passed on,
      repurposed, and cared for again.
